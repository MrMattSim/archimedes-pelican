Here we visualize a 13-dimensional data set 
consisting of characteristics of 13 different
wines. This data set is a common data set for
machine learning classification algorithms.
There are three classes corresponding to three wines
from the same region of Italy.

This paticular example illustrates how to combine HTML inputs
in the form of buttons to compare classes of data against 
one another.
 
By selecting from the nine different categories with HTML buttons,
the data is automatically filtered for display.
