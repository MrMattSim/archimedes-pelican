This is a visualization of a data set of various
characteristics of three different wines from 
the same region of Italy (from the UC Irvine 
Machine Learning data repository).

The data has been split into 9 (totally artificial) categories
to illustrate the use of HTML widgets and Angular.js 
to filter data and compare classes against one another.
