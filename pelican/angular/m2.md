Illustrates the use of a custom angular directive 
that can take arguments for the variables to plot
on the x and y axis.

To share a selection between the two, the <code>irisSelected</code>
variable is used. 

However, with Angular, <code>ng-init</code> creates
a new property for each element, meaning there are by default two 
instances of <code>irisSelected</code> created - one for each 
Angular scatterplot directive.
