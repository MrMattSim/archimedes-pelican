Example illustrating the use of a custom Angular directive
that takes arguments for the x- and y-axis variables to plot. 
This is used to make two scatter plots.

<br />
<br />

The scatter plots also share a selection via the <code>irisSelected</code>
variable. Any selected point on a chart is stored in the <code>irisSelected</code> 
variable. This makes it accessible to other parts of the page.

<br />
<br />

More importantly, the <code>irisSelected</code> variable provides a mechanism for 
linking charts with shared information independently, obviating the need for 
hard-coded chart linking through, e.g., mouseover or mouseout events.

<br />
<br />

With this Angular approach, charts do not need to know about each other.
They only need to know about the controller. 
The controller manages the global variable scope and the
shared variables contained therein.
