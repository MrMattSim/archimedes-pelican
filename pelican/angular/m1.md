Multi-dangular example: two independent Angular directives
(custom HTML tags) are defined. These directives 
share the same scope, so they are able to access
the same data and the same variables.

By adding watch functions for different variables 
to the Angular directives, we enable the directives
to act upon the data, and be acted upon by the data,
independently of one another.

This is a nice abstraction for modular design.
