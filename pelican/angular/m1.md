An example illustrating the use of two 
independent Angular components sharing 
common variables.

<br />
<br />

These Angular components share the same scope,
so they are able to access the same data and the same variables. 

<br/>
<br/>

By adding watch functions for different variables 
to the Angular directives, we enable the directives
to act upon the data, and be acted upon by the data,
independently of one another.

<br/>
<br/>

This allows us to design modular visualization 
components, and more rapidly prototype.
(But first we need to figure out how to 
organize that code better.)
