A live-updating page demonstrating the use of 
an Angular watcher from an Angular directive.
(Using Angular watchers from Angular controllers is a 
straightforward case, but using them from Angular 
directives is more tricky.) 

<br />
<br />

The Angular controller starts loading a large-ish (~2MB) 
CSV file when the page first loads. This takes a few seconds,
and a in the meantime the directive is created. The directive
is created with a loading message that turns into a success 
message when the data finishes loading.
