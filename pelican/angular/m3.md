Graduating to a more complicated D3 plot.

Here we visualize a 13-dimensional data set 
consisting of characteristics of 13 different
wines. This data set is a common data set for
machine learning classification algorithms.
There are three classes corresponding to three wines
from the same region of Italy.

This plot demonstrates the use of HTML intpus to 
filter the data.
