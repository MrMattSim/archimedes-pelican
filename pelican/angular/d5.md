This Dangular example adds the ability to push and pop elements 
of the data array, which in turn controls the pie chart.

The controller begins by initializing the data array.
Agnular then loops over each element of this array,
and creates an HTML inptu widget for each array value.
Each input widget is linked to the array value.

Next we create buttons that are linked to various
actions on the controller - reset, push, and pop.
Each of these modifies our array of data.

We then create our Angular directive, which utilizes the 
data to draw a pie chart with D3. This is using the 
same array of data that is linked to our HTML input widgets,
and the same array of data that is being manipulated
when we click the buttons on the page.
