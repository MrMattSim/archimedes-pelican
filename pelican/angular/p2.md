Welcome to the tabbed navigation example! This tabbed navigation example
demonstrates the use of the Angular <code>$compile</code> function
to dynamically inject Angular directives and have Angular pick them up
and evaluate them.

Each of the tab pages is loaded when the user clicks the tab name.
The page content is dynamically generated by a directive.
The page-generating directive also inserts another Angular directive,
<code>helloworld</code>, to test that Angular picks up the new directives 
and evaluates them.
